Description: nMOLDYN is an interactive program for the analysis of Molecular
        Dynamics simulations. It is especially designed for the computation
        and decomposition of neutron scattering spectra. The structure and
        dynamics of the simulated systems can be characterized in terms of
        various space and time correlation functions. To analyze the dynamics
        of complex systems, rigid-body motions of arbitrarily chosen molecular
        subunits can be studied.
