This is version 2.2 of nMoldyn, an interactive program for the
analysis of Molecular Dynamics trajectories. This program is
copyrighted but free to use for anyone under the CeCILL license,
see the file LICENSE for details.

nMoldyn should work with all major variants of Unix. There is little
system-specific code in nMoldyn itself, so porting nMoldyn to non-Unix
systems should be possible. However, we cannot provide any support for
this.

If you have any questions about nMoldyn that are not answered on the
Web page mentioned above, please contact the authors.

Installation
============

nMoldyn requires the Python interpreter (version 1.6 or higher)
with the Tk interface installed, and the Molecular Modeling Toolkit
(MMTK), version 2.2 or higher. Make sure that these components work
properly before installing nMoldyn.

Then type

    python setup.py install

On most systems this will require root permissions, as by default
the files will be installed in the same directory as the Python
interpreter. Other directories can be specified, type

    python setup.py --help install

for explanations. Once installation is finished, type

    xMoldyn

to run the interactive program or

    pMoldyn

to run a batch-mode calculation.
